### Project Overview

**Data Preprocessing:**
- **Handled missing values:** Ensured data quality by addressing any missing or null values in the dataset.
- **Encoded categorical features:** Transformed categorical data into numerical format to make it compatible with machine learning algorithms.
- **Scaled numerical features:** Standardized the numerical data to ensure that features are on a similar scale, which helps improve the performance of certain algorithms.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- **Visualized data distributions:** Used plots and charts to understand the distribution of various features and their potential impact on house prices.
- **Explored relationships between features:** Investigated correlations and relationships between different features to identify which attributes most significantly affect house prices.

**Feature Engineering:**
- **Created new features:** Developed additional features from existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- **Selected relevant features:** Chose the most important features for modeling to reduce complexity and improve model performance.

**Model Building:**
- **Implemented multiple algorithms:** Tried different machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to find the best model.
- **Trained and tested models:** Split the data into training and testing sets to train the models and evaluate their performance on unseen data.

**Model Evaluation:**
- **Evaluated model performance:** Used metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess how well each model predicts house prices.
- **Compared models:** Analyzed the results of different models to determine which one provides the most accurate predictions.

### Conclusion
